General test strategy is to manually go in and try each of these things:

New Game:
* Are all expected items displayed?
* Are all items at 0
* Does the UI show the appropriate values when 10 of an item are crafted?

New Game:
* Change settings to 2 for base cost, 1.01 for multiplier, 1 for productivity multiplier
* Create a bunch of iron plates or something
* Does the appropriate message get displayed?
* Does the productivity multiplier stop at 3?
* Save the Game

Load that save game:
* Does it have all the displays still in the UI?

Logs removed:
* Have I removed all logs from the game? Validate with `tail -f %APPDATA%/Factorio/factorio-current.log`

Before uploading:
* Update version number
* Zip files
* Delete mod / zipped mod from mod folder
* Move new zipped mod to mod folder
* Run above tests
* Update changelog
* Push to git
* Upload to Factorio
