Version: 0.1
  Major Features:
    - Initial commit. When you make something a lot, you get better at making it!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
  Minor Features:
    - Added settings for base cost, cost multiplier, and productivity addition for items / fluids
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed fluids so they work, fluid cost is default 10x higher than non fluids
    - Hid technology from the players
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed fluid productivity, as it wasn't using the settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed fill / empty barrel recipes from the productivity as they would give infinite fluids insanely quickly
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3
  Features:
    - Added option to only enable for products that can use productivity
    - Cost Multiplier is now a double, enabling 1.5
  Bugfixes:
    - Updated code to use appropriate cost variable for fluids
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.4
  Bugfixes:
    - Set minimum for multiplier to 1.01
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
  Major Features:
    - Completely changed how the mod works. It no longer uses technologies, and instead uses production statistics
    - Added a screen to see the productivity bonus per item, viewable with CTRL + P or a shortcut button
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed bug when recipe prototypes doesn't have allow_productivity
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
  Features:
    - Updated the settings to be runtime. Now you can change them midgame, which will recalculate your productivity bonuses
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug where the game would crash if you removed a mod that added recipes
    - Fixed a bug where I wasn't using the fluid settings properly
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
  Features:
    - Reworked the internals of the mod (again) to hopefully add some more consistency.
    - Productive Productivity now simply sets the recipe's productivity. This means it is not compatible with other mods that also set recipe productivity during runtime.
  Bugfixes:
    - Should no longer crash on opening the GUI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.6
  Bugfixes:
    - Factorio by default floors productivity_bonus value to two decimal places. Because it's a float, which can have a negative error, this causes certain numbers to be done incorrectly. This was causing many notifications when I used 1.05 (which in lua is actually 1.0499999523162841796875) as it rounded down to 1.04, and the mod kept trying to set it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
  Bugfixes:
    - Huge thanks to @josephquesnel for fixing the issue where this mod would overwrite productivity research. It now plays nicely and adds its bonus to the research bonus.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed a call to recalculate the list of items to process, as it was causing lag when there was a large amount of items. This shouldn't cause issues, but please let me know if you find anything problematic.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed the issue where the mod would not update the list of items properly.
